CatSolver

Problem: Stolen from the latest Professor Layton game on the 3DS.  You have a
5x5 grid with 8 white cats and 1 black cat arranged like this:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>-</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>B</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>-</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>-</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>-</td>
 </tr>
</table>

 White and black cats can jump over white cats to end up in an empty space,
 removing the jumped over white cat. Your goal is to have the black cat
 end up at the center again and with no white cats remaining on the board.  Cats
 can jump either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
